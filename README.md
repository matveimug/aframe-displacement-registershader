Writing a displacement shader in A-Frame
=========================

This example shows how to write custom shaders (GLSL) and use them to create effects in A-Frame / three.js / WebGL.

Click `Show` in the header to see the demo. 


Features
------------

- A basic webserver defined by `server.js`
- Shaders are compiled by `glslify`. Compilation isn't necessary, but makes it possible to import helper functions through NPM.
- The component `material-displacement` is defined by `index.js`. It uses our custom shaders to create a THREE.ShaderMaterial and attach it to the entity.
