Writing a displacement shader in A-Frame
=========================

This example shows how to write custom shaders (GLSL) and use them to create effects in A-Frame / three.js / WebGL.

Click `Show` in the header to see the demo. 


Features
------------

On the back-end,
- A basic webserver defined by `server.js`
- Shaders are compiled by `glslify`. Compilatio
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
